# Complex-Ecosystem-Simulation-with-Reinforcement-Learning
**Readme:**
1. Load the code into a C++ compiler.
2. Ensure required libraries (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, etc.) are installed.
3. Compile and run the code.
4. Observe the simulation results, displaying population changes and actions taken by the agents.

**Advanced Customization:**
- Customize parameters such as initial populations, birth and death rates, simulation steps, training episodes, and learning rate for different scenarios.
- Extend the ecosystem model with additional dynamics or complex reward functions.

**Resources:**
- Q-learning and reinforcement learning concepts: Study tutorials and resources available online.
- Explore advanced reinforcement learning algorithms for more sophisticated scenarios.
